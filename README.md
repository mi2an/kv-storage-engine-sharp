# Build your Own Key-Value Storage Engine

This repository contains my version of the ["Build Your Own Key-Value Storage Engine" series](https://read.thecoder.cafe/p/build-your-own-kv-engine) from the [Coder Cafe](https://read.thecoder.cafe/s/coding-corner) by Teiva Harsanyi.

I’ll be using this repository mainly as a place to learn and experiment.
That said, I may apply some concepts I want to master along the way, so expect to find overengineering here and there.

Anyway, I welcome contributions to this repository, so feel free to get involved.
